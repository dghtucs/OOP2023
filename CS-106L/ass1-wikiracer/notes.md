It's undeniable: human beings are obsessed with finding patterns. Whether it's in the mysteries of language, the beauties of art, or the depths of strategic games, finding patterns is built into our DNA. In fact, some biologists believe that finding patterns is what sets us apart as a species.

One interesting place to find interesting patterns is Wikipedia. For example, we can play a game called WikiRacer, where we try to move from one article to another with the fewest number of clicks. Try a round online before you move on!
